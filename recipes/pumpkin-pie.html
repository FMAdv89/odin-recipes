        <h2 class="categorie">Description</h2>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp Pass the whipped cream and enjoy the looks of sheer ecstasy on everyone's face! Fresh pumpkin must be used in order for it to have the best flavor and texture. Believe me, fresh pumpkin is better than canned!</p>
        <h2 class="categorie">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 sugar pumpkin</li>
            <li> 1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch single crust pie</li>
            <li> 2 eggs</li>
            <li> 1 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li> 2 ½ teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
            <li> 1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="categorie">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Cut pumpkin in half and remove seeds. Place cut side down on a cookie sheet lined with lightly oiled aluminum foil. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the flesh is tender when poked with a fork. Cool until just warm. Scrape the pumpkin flesh from the peel. Either mash, or puree in small batches in a blender. Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C.)</li>
            <li> In a large bowl, slightly beat eggs. Add brown sugar, flour, salt, 2 cups of the pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spice, and evaporated milk. Stir well after each addition.</li>
            <li> Pour mixture into the unbaked pastry shell. Place a strip of aluminum foil around the edge of the crust to prevent over browning.</li>
            <li> Bake 10 minutes at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake an additional 40 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Remove the strip of foil about 20 minutes before the pie is done so that the edge of the crust will be a light golden brown. Cool pie, and refrigerate overnight for best flavor.</li>
        </ol>
